_Frontend for Aetheryte API_

## Prerequisites

- Node `16.13.0`

## [Documentation](docs/INDEX.md)

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run Server:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
Check your terminal for the address, the default is `http://127.0.0.1:8788`

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use docker to run the server:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> NOTE: any changes to the `Dockerfile` or dependencies will require you to rebuild the images.
