            Selling transmogs through the auction house is especially

          5. Speculation on Mounts and Pets
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Mounts and pets are always a great resource for getting WoW Classic
          gold safely, because they are difficult to get, but can be sold or
          exchanged very quickly.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Look for them in solo dungeons, mythic raids and in faction
          interactions. Do not count on a high chance, but due to constant
          attempts and the creation of alternative characters, you will still
          have more options for getting Pandaria gold in this way.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          For example, Reins of the Swift Lovebird is already showing the peak
          of its growth in value.

          6. Crafting Items - Especially for Monks
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Monks are a new class that will be created primarily because of the
          new gameplay. This means that all items and resources for it will have
          a high cost.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>Leatherworkers - earns on light armor.</li>
          <li>
            Blacksmiths and Jewelcrafters make weapons for damage and rings for
            magical defense and stats. Relevant for all classes.
          </li>
          <li>Inscription - creates sought-after glyphs and scrolls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The craft itself is cheaper, especially if you collect resources
          yourself, and the prices are high, especially in the early stages,
          when you can get thousands of Warcraft gold without even leaving the
          peaceful zone.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
          7. Open World Farming with AoE Looting
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This is a new mechanic that significantly increases the speed of
          collecting resources and trophies. This way you will collect herbs and
          drops from monsters faster, especially if you have good AoE damage.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          It is better to hunt Silithus, or Deadwind Pass. From humanoids, you
          can get not only cheap WoW MoP gold, but also fabrics that are needed
          by tailors and can only be obtained by drops.

          8. Fishing and Cooking
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Fishing and cooking are back on the list of the best activities for
          constantly getting WoW Classic Mists of Pandaria gold.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Fish as a source of reagents and buffs through cooking and alchemy is
          always valuable. Savory Deviate Delight, Nightfin Soup will be useful.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          You can sell the fish itself, cook from it, or grind it into reagents
          and sell them - all methods will bring MoP gold for sale, and here
          everything depends on your desires.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The most important thing is that you can get WoW gold safely without
          hunting and PVP, just do not forget to turn off Warmode and choose
          locations that do not pass through the respawn of aggressive monsters.

          9. Trading at the Auction
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The auction is the strongest side of World of Warcraft, because it
          allows you to trade and make a profit without active game shops. Look
          at the prices, add the product and go about your business. When
          selling, you will receive a notification and come pick up your World
          of Warcraft gold.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Remember that the demand for literally everything related to Monks
          will be huge at the very beginning, so take advantage of the
          excitement and earn cheap Warcraft gold.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
          10. Selling Summoning Services, Portals, Boosts
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          If you are a mage, Warlock-Demonologist, or Druid. Then you can create
          portals to farm spots, raids, or the capitals of Stormwind or
          Orgrimmar and charge players for portals and fast travel.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Additionally, you can help other players gain a level in the starting
          locations so that they get the first 20 levels faster and can do more
          interesting things, and you will get additional WoW MoP gold for sale
          for this.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Remember, players are always ready to pay for their comfort, the
          question is always in availability and benefit.
