            Your Mythic+ raids require a careful approach and accelerated
            progression. If you take the right equipment, plan your route to
            engage in less combat and start the battle with the boss faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stock up on consumables and be sure to take into account the current
            week's affixes. Act quickly and distribute your roles correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dodge boss attacks to reduce the load on the healer and use addons
            to plan the right routes, take into account the damage to the boss
            and know which skills to dodge.
