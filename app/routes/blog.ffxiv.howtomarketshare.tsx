          How to earn gil with the market overview
        </h1>
        <h2 id="tldr-">TLDR:</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest way to earn gil with this is by selling items that are{' '}
          <strong>
            <em>green</em>
          </strong>{' '}
          or{' '}
          <strong>
            <em>blue*</em>
          </strong>{' '}
          in the price overview. (These have increased in price or are out of
          stock, making them much more profitable to buy on other servers to
          sell on your own or craft/gather.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
            Tip: If it&#39;s blue it means they are extremely profitable to sell
            as none are listed on your market board and you can sell for any
            price you want to.
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          First... pick a search. The weekly overview, price percent increase or
          fast-selling searches are great places to start. You can make your own
          search by changing the numbers, however, we have created searches with
          defaults open for public usage under the{' '}
          <a href="https://saddlebagexchange.com/ffxiv/marketshare/queries">
            main page for the market overviews.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>Then here is how you read the chart:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ✅ Big boxes with a big current market value{' '}
            <strong>earn lots of gil.</strong> They are good items to
            buy/resell, craft, or gather
          </li>
          <li>
            ❌ Little boxes with a small current market value are bad items to
            buy/resell, craft, or gather. (They don&#39;t earn much gil.)
          </li>
          <li>
            ✅ <em>When the price overview is bright green:</em> You should
            buy/resell, craft or gather and sell at{' '}
            <strong>current prices</strong> to <strong>earn lots of gil</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            ❌ <strong>Stay far away from items that are bright red!!!</strong>:
            They are probably unprofitable, have crashed in price, or only show
            big gil earned due to gil laundering which does not show real sales.
          </li>
          <li>
            ✅{' '}
            <strong>
              <em>When the price overview is light blue:</em>
            </strong>{' '}
            <strong>These items will earn high amounts of gil.</strong> This is
            the best opportunity to buy/resell, craft, or gather!!! This lets
            you sell at any price you want to.{' '}
          </li>

            search to find specific items on the <em>Region Price History</em>{' '}

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-search-for-items">How to search for items</h2>
        <p>
          The market overview has several options which point out the{' '}
          <em>best</em> selling item based on a number of categories{' '}
          <strong>depending</strong> on the search inputs you pick:
        </p>
        {/*<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17516896/225358969-1b234617-eac9-4887-a446-6fc87d715d45.png" alt="image"></p>*/}
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <code>Sales Amount</code> divided by the{' '}
            <code>Time Period</code> gives you the sales per hour or sale rate.
            (i.e. how fast an item sells.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Time Period</code> is how much time you want to search over.
            You can search from 1 to 168 hours. (24 hours is one day, and 168
            hours is one week.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>Sales Amount</code> is how many sales you want to find in
            that time period, you can pick from 1 to a max of 40 sales (we only
            store 40 sales in our DB, for finding data on any items selling 40
            or more sales we make API calls to universalis.)
          </li>
          <li>
            As the most sales you can pick is 40 if you want faster-selling
            items then pick a lower <code>Time Period</code> to find faster sale
            rates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Average Price</code> will find items that sell on average for
            that price or higher. The lowest amount of gil you can search for is
            10 gil.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Item Filters will let you filter specific categories of items or
            multiple categories at once. Make sure to unselect the{' '}
            <code>All</code> checkbox if you want to search for specific
            categories
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <code>Sort Results By</code> is most important as it will change
          the results you see. To make sure our chart load correctly we only
          pick the top 200 items sorted by the value of the field you pick in
          the <code>Sort Results By</code> option:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Market Value:</strong> * Simplest metric to use. Shows what
            items earned the most gil by adding together all sales revenue from
            all items that match search input to show the 200 top earners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Percent Changed:</strong> Highlights what is out of stock or
            has increased in price. (These are great opportunities to trade when
            buying from other servers to sell on your own.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase Amount:</strong> This shows you the fastest-selling
            items. (Commonly the best items are sold within stacks of 1 or small
            stacks, but they are also the easiest to sell fast)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantity Sold:</strong> This shows the items that sell the
            highest stacks the fastest (these are commonly fast-selling items
            that sell in stacks of 99 for common commodities or 9999 for
            crystals)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Average Price:</strong> This shows the items which on
            average sell for the most gil, however, some very big sales can
            offset this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Median:</strong> This shows which items sell for the most
            gil on a regular basis and it&#39;s more consistent than the average
            price.
