                Saddlebag Exchange and Oribos Exchange collect and use data the
                same way by recording the minimum prices and quantities each

                Well any experienced enchanter will tell you that people pay for
                combat stats. Full stat enchants are often required for raiding.
                A raider on a budget will often choose to forgo the extra out of
                combat stats if it saves them some gold. Especially when the
                quality 2 version exists at a much lower price with close to the

                    This comes from the TSM regional sales api data and measures

                    This is the best sale rate available, but it does often have
                    flaws. It relies on TSM users over the past 2 weeks. If very
                    few sellers in a small market are actively using TSM the
                    sale rate may be far lower than reality. Take it with a
                    grain of salt and use it more of a guideline than a rule.

                    A general rule is that if an items decline rate is 10 times
                    the TSM sale rate its probably a shortage caused by market
                    manipulation than a naturally occuring shortage.

                This all comes from prior experience and game knowledge, but I
                can make the following recommendations:

                    <strong>Light Touch Approach:</strong> For crafters the idea
                    is that you need a light touch. Less is more at a high
                    price, as you get more profit with less items. Craft too
                    many and not all of your items will sell.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500">
                  <p>
                    <strong>Reasonable Pricing:</strong> Understand how much
                    people are willing to pay and don't get too greedy. For a
                    blue enchant it is not likely people will actually pay 10k
                    or more for the item, but 500g to 2k is very reasonable and
                    profitable when this usually costs around 100 to 150g to
                    craft.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-500">
                  <p>
                    <strong>Multiple Price Points:</strong> Don't post at a
                    single price! Average out your profits by posting small
                    stacks at many different prices. Small stacks at many
                    different prices will sell far better than large stacks at a
                    single price and will allow prices to go further up to
                    capture even higher prices. The higher prices may not sell,
                    but the lower ones will average out your profits to be much
                    higher then they would otherwise be normally.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Fill Market Gaps:</strong> Lets look at this
                    snapshot of{' '}
                    <code className="bg-gray-200 px-2 py-1 rounded">
                      Enchant Ring - Devotion of Haste
                    </code>{' '}
                    and we can see gaps in prices between 151 to 189 and 189 to
                    250g and none above 250g! Posting small stacks at different
                    prices between these will make your items more likely to
                    sell.
