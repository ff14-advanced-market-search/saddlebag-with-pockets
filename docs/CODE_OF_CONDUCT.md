# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Enforcement

If the Project Stewards receive a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, the Project Stewards will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The Project Stewards will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the Project Stewards may issue sanctions without notice.
